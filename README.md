## Project motivation

After learning css grid through tutorials i decided to implement the concept i had learnt in a project. I used css grid in my previous project (2020 August Portfolio) but to solidify this concept i had to create a project which is centered on grids. This lead me to choosing Instagram. 

The following questions determined how i was going to implement the project while simultaneously grasping the concept of grids. 

* which section am i going to clone
* am i going to clone the web version alone or the app version alone or both
* am i going to implement the grid across the full page or the main section alone
* am i going to simulate a logged in or logged out account
