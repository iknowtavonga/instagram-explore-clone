# Instagram Explore Page

## Project motivation

After learning css grid through tutorials i decided to implement the concept i had learnt in a project. I used css grid in my previous project (2020 August Portfolio) but to solidify this concept i had to create a project which is centered on grids. This lead me to choosing Instagram. 

The following questions determined how i was going to implement the project while simultaneously grasping the concept of grids. 

* which section am i going to clone
* am i going to clone the web version alone or the app version alone or both
* am i going to implement the grid across the full page or the main section alone
* am i going to simulate a logged in or logged out account

## Web version

The web version of this explore page does not contain any videos and this made the grid 

### Header

The header was flexed to allow for an equal amount of space between the following items:
* Logo
* Search bar
* Login and sign up buttons

### Main

The main section contains a combination of 3x2 grids along with a title separating recent images and top posts.

## App version

The app version was a little more complicated than the web version as it had more grid elements included along with a sticky header and fixed footer. If more time arises i might optimise the app version for tablet devices because the elements look stretched on those devices.
